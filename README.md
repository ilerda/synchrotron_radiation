# synchrotron_radiation - Simulate Synchrotron Radiation
************************************************

synchrotron_radiation is a software library used for the efficient simulation of electromagnetic fields due to moving point charges in an extended field. One application of this lies in synchrotron radiation, as detected in circular particle accelerators. However, the library is capable of simulating the fields due to any arbitrary motion of charged particles. The underlying method was developed as an alternative to the finite element method, which cannot easily be used to calculate the fields due to individual particles.

This can be used to visualise the electric fields or the radiation in an extended 2D space. The contained functions could also be extended to investigate the radiation profile in 3D.

Run the examples in 'test/' to get an idea of how the library works.
